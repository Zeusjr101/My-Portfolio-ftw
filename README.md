# My Portfolio

## This is a Funtional Website.

- My motivation for getting in to coding is so i can learn how to building webiste and backend developer.

- Building this website was to see if i can build something from nothing and from what i learned in class.

* There were alot of problems in the bring of this journey from where to start but at the end of it all I'm happy results.
* I learned that if i put my mind to it and read / do research I'm able to take on any challenge.
